![Automating administrative tasks in Microsoft 365](automation-itpro.png)

## Abstract

In the old days, scheduling a script was easy: you just created a scheduled task on your favorite Windows Server and made that run your PowerShell script exactly how and when you wanted. Along came the cloud and our toolbox expanded dramatically: Azure Automation, Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps and the Power Platform all offer some interesting possibilities to make stuff happen on a schedule. This session will provide you with a comprehensive overview of when to use what, their cost aspects and technical boundaries.
