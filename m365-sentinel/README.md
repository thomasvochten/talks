![Monitoring Microsoft 365 Security with Microsoft Sentinel](m365-sentinel.png)

## Abstract

It’s no secret that bad actors are everywhere, and they’re also eying your precious Microsoft 365 environment. Deploying Microsoft Sentinel is a powerful and intelligent way to not only stay ahead of those threats but also act on them. This session will introduce you to the wonderful world of the security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. You will learn how to get started, how to connect to Microsoft 365 and how to detect, investigate and respond to the security events that matter.

This session is co-presented with [Jussi Roine](https://jussiroine.com/).
