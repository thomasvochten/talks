![A primer on using git and GitHub](git-github.png)

## Abstract

The world is driven by open source: software, scripts, documentation and even data are freely available for anyone to use. The true power of open source however, is your ability to contribute back to the projects you care about and make them even better. Thatâ€™s where git and GitHub come into play as a vast ecosystem of powerful tools and capabilities. Although anyone with at least some technical abilities will be able to get started, it is not easy to understand the lingo, the conventions and the tools involved. This session will provide you with everything you need to get started with confidence.
