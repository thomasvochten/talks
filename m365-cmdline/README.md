## Abstract

Microsoft 365 has many admin centers that let you adjust various settings, but sometimes you just need to work with the command line. There are a lot of options these days: PowerShell for the Microsoft Graph, and different CLIs - or Command Line Interfaces. You use these not because they are cool, but because they help you with a specific problem. In this session we will explore the different tools that you can use, which problems they address and how to use them in an automation scenario. The goal is to manage your tenant more efficiently. Whether you are new to these tools or an experienced user, you will learn practical tips and tricks that will save you time and effort.
