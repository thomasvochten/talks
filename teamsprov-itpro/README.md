![Provisioning Microsoft Teams | Beyond the next-next-finish](teamsprov-itpro.png)

## Abstract

When you have Microsoft 365, you have Microsoft Teams. At first sight, there’s nothing special you need to do - it’s just there for everyone to use. Remember that feeling when you first discovered your 50 people organization created 200 teams in just the first few weeks? Luckily, there are plenty of ways to still support a fierce adoption of the platform, while keeping a minimum of control to make sure fiascos like that don’t happen anymore. Obstructing your users to create new teams is not the goal of course, but an intelligent provisioning engine goes a long way to keep everyone happy. This technical session will give you a comprehensive overview of some of the techniques & technologies involved.
