![Microsoft 365 tenant setup & configuration. Been there, done that?](m365-tenantconfig.png)

## Abstract

As IT professionals, we mostly use PowerShell to interact with Microsoft 365. Many services provide us with a native PowerShell module, but One of the most important steps in your Microsoft 365 journey is setting up and configuring your tenant. Itâ€™s just next, next, finish - right? Look again! In this session, Thomas will guide you through some essential tasks and decisions you need to make as well as the foundational technologies you might want to revisit (DNS anyone?). You will learn about some hidden gems and good practices that will help you optimize your tenant performance and security. Additionally, we will cover some more advanced scenarios, such as multi-geo and multi-tenant deployments. Whether you are a new or an existing Microsoft 365 IT professional, this session will provide you with valuable insights and tips from the field.
