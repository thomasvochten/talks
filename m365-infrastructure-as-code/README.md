![Microsoft 365 Infrastructure-as-Code](m365-infrastructure-as-code.png)

## Abstract

Many cloud professionals are acquainted with the concepts of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and Configuration-as-Code (CaC). They both provide a descriptive model to deploy or manage a cloud environment and focus on the outcome, rather than the actual procedure to get there. This session will apply these constructs to the wonderful world of Microsoft 365. We will look at the technologies involved, such as PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) and the potential drawbacks, such as the dreaded “configuration drift”. Can we really create repeatable configurations and deploy them in multiple tenants? Can we export and import settings at will or compare configurations over time? Join this session to find out!
