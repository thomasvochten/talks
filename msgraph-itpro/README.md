![Using the Microsoft Graph for the reluctant IT Pro](msgraph-itpro.png)

## Abstract

As IT professionals, we mostly use PowerShell to interact with Microsoft 365. Many services provide us with a native PowerShell module, but that often leaves much to be desired. Ever tried to create a new Teams tab or Planner task with PowerShell, retrieve mails from a resource mailbox or obtain your company’s Secure Score?  That all becomes a breeze - and there’s much more! The Microsoft Graph is a powerful gateway to the entire Microsoft 365 ecosystem. This session will tell you how to get started, how to deal with authentication and authorization and how to leverage PowerShell to unleash its power.
