Guests & External Access](m365-guest-ext.png)

## Abstract

Microsoft 365 lets you work with external users in different apps and services. But managing these users can be hard, especially if you want to comply with your security and governance policies. In this session, you will see how to set up and control guest and external access in Microsoft 365. You will find out how to automate and track guest and external access scenarios, such as adding, deleting, or changing guests, applying conditional access and multi-factor authentication, and auditing guest actions and permissions. You will also learn how to fix common problems and how to use the newest features and updates for guest and external access.
